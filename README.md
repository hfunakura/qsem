# QSEM: an evaluation benchmark for analyses of interrogative sentences
This dataset is for examining the empirical coverage of syntax and semantics of interrogative sentences. It was introduced in this paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14737.

The main part of the paper consists of p1, ..., p5, and q. Here, q is a question, and p1, ..., p5 are responses to q. The paper uses this dataset to evaluate a computational system called ccg2hol, which is also expected to be published soon.

The ratio of the values in the "is_answer" column: 
| is_answer | Count |
|----------------|-------|
| yes            | 115   |
| unknown        | 21    |
| no             | 2     |
